# Overview
This example contains code samples to demonstrate that it is possible to post data from client code to controller and expect it to be deserialized into object of particular class. 

So that in method of controller we could perform some operation and return JSON to show to the client code what was the result of our operation.

Then client code could perform some checks on result JSON either it is error or success operation and apply some changes to UI.
